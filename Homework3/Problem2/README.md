# PL-2017-HW3-Problem2

## Goal
The goal of this problem is to implement an interpreter for the imperative language in Problem 2. 
The syntax and semantics of the language are defined in "hw3.pdf".

## Specification
- Implement the ***eval***, ***eval_aexp***, ***eval_bexp*** functions in the "c.ml".
- Do not modify the types and names of items in the "c.ml" except for the those functions.
- You can use the environment and memory implementation for the interpreter which are provided as built-in.

## Compilation and Execution
Compile and execute the interpreter as follows:
```
  make                (* for compilation *)
  ./run test/test1.m  (* running the interpreter *)
```

## How to Submit
Submit the single file "c.ml" via Blackboard. Submissions that are not compiled properly will get zero points.
